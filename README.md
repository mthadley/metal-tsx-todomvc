# TodoMVC with Metal-JSX and Typescript

An example project implementing [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) with [metal-jsx](https://github.com/metal/metal.js/tree/master/packages/metal-jsx) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

This was made to see how difficult it would be to add a useful amount of type safety to a project using `Metal.js`, despite there being no existing typings available. I would say the end result was very good. So good thats it's hard to imagine not using something like Typescript (or possibly flow) for any future javascript applications.

## Running

```sh
$ yarn install
$ npm run build
$ open dist/index.html
```
